        Welcome to Emerald Palace, a memorial to the late great Emily Parsonson. 
        This platform allows you to contribute to a collection of photographs, videos, and written memories 
        shared privately with her beloved family and friends. No sharing with Google, Facebook, etc.
        She was a private girl, and would prefer it this way.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-700" style="white-space:pre">
        Upload to the gallery "Photographs & Videos" or contribute a story or some words to the "Memories" blog. 
        Every piece of content you share becomes available for our little memorial community, but you can select to share with certain groups. 
        Please ensure you select your correct relationship to Emily in the profile section.

        Share your stories, preserve your memories, and remember Em's legacy in this private digital space.
